Thee Amazon Polarity Dataset, which contains over 35 million product reviews classified as positive or negative, provides valuable insights for businesses. Each review includes a rating indicating the customerâ€™s sentiment towards the product. This labeled dataset is highly useful for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning applications. Companies can leverage the dataset to refine their advertising and marketing strategies by analyzing customer feedback to understand which products are well-received and identifying key features that influence purchasing decisions. Such insights enable targeted marketing campaigns and improved product recommendations. Additionally, the dataset can be employed in recommendation systems to categorize products based on customer sentiment, thereby enhancing the organization and personalization of product recommendations. In this task we will be training a Bert Large language model on amazon polarity reviews dataset.
